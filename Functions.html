    <h1>JavaScript Higher Order Functions</h1>

    <h2><hr> ARRAY METHODS  </h2> 
    <p>filter(SCRIPTS, script => script.living) this builds a new array of the elements that passed the test which is script => script.living.
      map(rtlScripts, s => s.name) === rtlScripts.map(s => s.name) this returns a new array with the same length which is transformed by the function passed in after the array. 
      reduce([1, 2, 3, 4], (a, b) => a + b, 0) this takes (an array, a function, a start index) and manipulates the array acording to the function this example adds together the array 
    </p> 
    <h2><hr> COMPOSABILITY  </h2>
    <p> Composability abstracting is better than writing new functions becuase it can handle larger arrays higher order functions truely shine when use in combontion with eachother. for example console.log(Math.round(average(
        SCRIPTS.filter(s => !s.living).map(s => s.year)))); this function uses the built in Math.round(), average() whcih was made adds all nums together then divides by index+1.
        Strings and charecter codes arr-> script.ranges.some(([from, to]) => { return code >= from && code &lt; to; }) method is another higher order function which tests wether that function returns true for any elements in the array
        horseShoe.codePointAt(0); is a function which returns the code for the charecter at a specific index in unicode. Normal letters are three digits and emojis appear to be double.
    </p>  
    <h2><hr> RECOGNIZING TEXT </h2> 
    
    <p>
      We have a characterScript function and a way to correctly loop over characters. 
    </p>

    <br> - Name value pair array being sorted returns 2 arrays one with the number of true statment and one with all the false {name: false, count: 2}, {name: true, count: 3}.
    <br> - The function test how many are larger than 2 there for 3 are larger true  and 2 are less than 2 false. 
    <br> - Arrays provide a number of useful higher-order methods. You can use forEach to loop over the elements in an array. The filter method returns a new array containing only the elements that pass the predicate function.
    <br> Transforming an array by putting each element through a function is done with map. You can use reduce to combine all the elements in an array into a single value. The some method tests whether any element matches a 
    <br> given predicate function. And findIndex finds the position of the first element that matches a predicate.
    <br> console.log(arrays.reduce( (a, b) => a.concat(b))); -> how to concatinate a group of unknown arrays
